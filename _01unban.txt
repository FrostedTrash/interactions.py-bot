The 01 ban is not a diffrent ban, it means you was caught trying to unban.

1. Open rockstar launcher app on your computer.
2. Login to your old account (THE ONE WITH YOUR ORIGINAL BAN).
3. Delete C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\CitizenFX
4. Delete C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\DigitalEntitlements
5. Go to C:\Windows\System32 > and delete nvml.dll
6. Then load fivem, and your old ban will be back without the _01.
7. Then follow a normal method.
